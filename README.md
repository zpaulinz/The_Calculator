# The_Calculator
A simple calculator application

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
```
XCalculator/
├── src/
│   ├── operations.py        
│   ├── user_input.py        
│   └── main.py              
├── tests/
│   ├── test_operations.py   
│   ├── test_user_input.py   
│   └── test_main.py         
└── README.md                
```
In this structure:
- `operations.py` contains the mathematical functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- `user_input.py` handles user input, ensuring that the user provides valid data
- `main.py` contains the core logic that integrates all the functions and runs the calculator
- `tests/` includes unit tests for all major components of the project
